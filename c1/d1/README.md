### Variables and Functions

#### Part 1: Variables

1. Declare a variable `name` and assign it your name.
2. Create three variables `a`, `b`, and `c` and assign them different numeric values.
3. Define a string variable `favorite_color` and assign it your favorite color.
4. Experiment with variable naming conventions. Declare a variable using camelCase, another using snake_case, and another using PascalCase.

#### Part 2: Functions

5. Write a function `greet` that takes a name as a parameter and prints a personalized greeting.
6. Create a function `calculate_area` that calculates and returns the area of a rectangle. The function should take two parameters: length and width.
7. Define a function `is_even` that takes an integer as a parameter and returns True if it's even, and False otherwise.
8. Write a function `print_pattern` that prints a simple pattern of your choice using print statements.
9. Create a function `concat_strings` that takes two strings as parameters and returns their concatenation.
10. Define a function `get_square_cube` that takes a number as a parameter and returns a tuple containing its square and cube.

#### Part 3: Mixed Operations

11. Write a function `calculate_total_cost` that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping cart. The function should take item prices as a list.
12. Create a function `reverse_list` that takes a list as a parameter and returns its reverse.
13. Define a function `count_vowels` that takes a string as a parameter and returns the count of vowels in it.
14. Write a function `average` that takes a list of numbers and returns their average.
15. Create a function `check_palindrome` that takes a string as a parameter and returns True if it's a palindrome, and False otherwise.

#### Part 4: More Challenges

16. Write a function `find_max_min` that takes a list of numbers and returns both the maximum and minimum values.
17. Define a function `calculate_discount` that calculates the discounted price of an item. It should take the original price and discount percentage as parameters.
18. Create a function `is_prime` that takes an integer as a parameter and returns True if it's a prime number, and False otherwise.
19. Write a function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number.
20. Define a function `print_triangle` that takes a number as a parameter and prints a triangle pattern with that many rows.
