### Python Dictionary Exercises

#### Part 1: Basic Operations

1. Create an empty dictionary called `empty_dict`.
2. Create a dictionary `student` with keys: 'name', 'age', 'grade', and corresponding values.
3. Add a new key-value pair to the `student` dictionary with the key 'course' and the value 'Python Programming'.
4. Remove the key 'grade' from the `student` dictionary.

#### Part 2: Access and Manipulation

5. Access and print the value of the 'age' key from the `student` dictionary.
6. Check if the key 'grade' is present in the `student` dictionary.
7. Iterate over the keys of the `student` dictionary and print each key.
8. Iterate over the values of the `student` dictionary and print each value.

#### Part 3: Dictionary Methods

9. Create a dictionary called `phone_numbers` with at least three key-value pairs (e.g., 'Alice': '123-456-7890').
10. Use the `get` method to retrieve the phone number for a contact. Handle the case where the contact is not present.
11. Use the `keys` method to get a list of all contacts in the `phone_numbers` dictionary.
12. Use the `values` method to get a list of all phone numbers in the `phone_numbers` dictionary.
13. Use the `items` method to iterate over the key-value pairs in the `phone_numbers` dictionary and print each pair.

#### Part 4: Advanced Dictionary Operations

14. Create two dictionaries, `dict1` and `dict2`, with some overlapping key-value pairs.
15. Merge the contents of `dict2` into `dict1`.
16. Remove a specific key-value pair from `dict1`.
17. Clear all elements from `dict2`.

#### Part 5: Nested Dictionaries

18. Create a nested dictionary called `school` with the keys 'students' and 'teachers'. Each key should have a list of names as its value.
19. Add a new student to the 'students' list in the `school` dictionary.
20. Update the name of a teacher in the 'teachers' list in the `school` dictionary.

### Note:
Encourage learners to use the official Python documentation or other online resources to explore additional dictionary methods and operations. These exercises cover a range of dictionary-related topics, including basic operations, methods, and handling nested dictionaries.

### Python Dictionary Exercises with User Input

#### Part 1: User Input and Dictionary Creation

1. Ask the user to enter their name and age. Create a dictionary called `user_info` with keys 'name' and 'age' and store the user's input as values.

2. Prompt the user to enter the names and ages of three friends. Create a dictionary called `friends_info` with the friend names as keys and their ages as values.

#### Part 2: User Input and Dictionary Manipulation

3. Ask the user to enter a course name and its duration in weeks. Create a dictionary called `course_info` with keys 'course' and 'duration' and store the user's input.

4. Prompt the user to enter a contact name and phone number. Add this information as a new key-value pair to the `phone_numbers` dictionary.

#### Part 3: User Input and Dictionary Iteration

5. Ask the user to enter the names of three countries and their respective capitals. Create a dictionary called `countries_info` with country names as keys and capital cities as values.

6. Print the information stored in the `countries_info` dictionary, displaying each country and its capital on a new line.

#### Part 4: User Input and Dictionary Updates

7. Ask the user to enter the name of a friend and their new age. Update the 'age' value in the `friends_info` dictionary for the specified friend.

8. Prompt the user to enter a course name and its updated duration. Update the 'duration' value in the `course_info` dictionary accordingly.

#### Part 5: User Input and Dictionary Deletion

9. Ask the user to enter the name of a friend to remove from the `friends_info` dictionary. Delete the corresponding key-value pair.

10. Prompt the user to enter a country name to remove from the `countries_info` dictionary. Delete the corresponding key-value pair.

### Note:
These exercises integrate user input to create, manipulate, and update dictionaries. Encourage learners to use the `input` function for receiving user input and guide them in applying dictionary operations based on the given tasks.
